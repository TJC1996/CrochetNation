//             <h2>Crochet Nation Was Born</h2>
//             <p>
//               Crochet Nation was founded in 2023 with the aim of making the world a better place.
//               Out of an idea of prayer and mediation and the creation of something beautiful personal useful and individual.
//             </p>
//             <p>
//               The inspiration was a melange of people who have taught me in my life - my mother has taught me to use color accordingly and she introduced me to the queen of all textiles Iris Apfel.  The function of Crochet Nation has a direct line to my grandmother Sophie who came over on a boat from Czechoslovakia. She was a seamstress.
//             </p>
//             <p>
//             She did beautiful fine handwork and her crochet and knitting skills were immense - along with her egg decorating and farming canning abilities. She taught me to crochet at a young age and I picked it up again as an adult.
//             </p>

//             <h2>Orders & Shipping Time</h2>
//             <p>
//             Crochet Nation puts prayer and good energy into each garment created. Many items made by Crochet Nation are made of bamboo yarn. Some of the other yarn types used frequently are organic cottons / hand dyed cottons , velvets and chenille. Some garments are made of recycled cleaned clothing items that have been turned into yarn. You can choose your own color scheme or pick from the items on the website. Each piece is one of a kind and typically takes 2-4 weeks to complete.

            <h2>Our Origin Story</h2>
            <p>
              In the heart of 2023, the seed for Crochet Nation took root and blossomed, driven by the vision of infusing the world with beauty and individuality, underpinned by a spirit of contemplation and intent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our story is a tapestry woven from the rich threads of lives that have touched and shaped my own. My mother, a vibrant colorist who introduced me to the textile doyenne, Iris Apfel, instilled in me a profound appreciation for hue and texture.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet, the heart of Crochet Nation pulses in rhythm with my grandmother Sophie, a skilled seamstress who journeyed across the seas from Czechoslovakia.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sophie's intricate handiwork was a marvel to behold. Her skills in crochet and knitting were second only to her adeptness at egg decoration and farming canning. I had the privilege of learning the art of crochet from her in my early years, a gift that I rediscovered and nurtured as an adult.
